## Note for Authors
A web service [jsoneditoronline.org](http://jsoneditoronline.org/) was used to make json content readable. 

There you can paste unformatted json text on the left screen and then make a conversion into json object tree. Also the tree can be sorted by a key, for that click on icon on the left-top corner of the object tree and choose `Sort > Ascending`.

Then click `Save > Save to disk` in the main menu.
